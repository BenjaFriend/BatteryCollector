## What is this?

Unreal Engine has a simple [tutorial series on C++ programming in Unreal Engine](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlv_N0_O1gYup-gvJtMsgJqnEB_dGiM4). However, this series was made a little while ago and in engine version 4.9, and there have been some changes to Unreal C++ over the past couple of version (mainly how the including of files is handled), and there were a couple people that I know struggling with converting this tutorial to the newer engine versions. 

What I have done is simplely follow the tutorial, but update the code so that it runs in Unreal Engine 4.18.3.

This is by no means a portfolio piece or anything like that, just an attempt to make Unreal's C++ a bit more accessible for some people. 

For the most part, each commit is a video, although in the beginning I got a little bit off track. 

I hope that this can help some people get into Unreal Engine C++ programming a little bit easier!
